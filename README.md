# Resume-Shortlister
A tool that can be used to parse and sort through a wide arrays of resumes according to specific needs to massively boost the time it takes to find the right candidate

## Features

* **Automated Data Extraction:** Intelligently parses PDF resumes to extract key details like name, experience, college, tech stack, and more.
* **AI-Powered:** Leverages the power of Google's Gemini model for high-accuracy information retrieval.
* **Persistent Storage:** Saves all extracted data to a `resume_data.csv` file, so you only need to process resumes once.
* **Powerful CLI:** A user-friendly command-line interface to view, search, and sort candidates based on various criteria.
* **Efficient Workflow:** Drastically reduces the manual effort and time spent on initial resume screening.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

```

resume-shortlister/
├── resumes/                \# Folder to store all candidate PDF resumes
├── .env                    \# Stores the secret Google API Key
├── .gitignore              \# Specifies files for Git to ignore (like .env)
├── main.py                 \# The main Python script containing all the logic
├── requirements.txt        \# A list of all required Python libraries
└── resume\_data.csv         \# The output file where structured data is stored (auto-generated)

````

-   **`main.py`**: The core application script. It handles file processing, API calls, and the command-line interface.
-   **`resumes/`**: Place all the resumes you want to process (in `.pdf` format) into this directory.
-   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python dependencies needed to run the project.
-   **`.env`**: A configuration file for storing your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. This is crucial for security and keeps your secret keys out of the main codebase.
-   **`resume_data.csv`**: This file is automatically generated by the `process` command. It acts as a local database of your candidates, making subsequent searches and sorts instantaneous.

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd resume-shortlister
````

**2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
Install all the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Set Up Your API Key**

  - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
  - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
  - Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

**5. Add Resumes**
Place the candidate resumes (in PDF format) into the `resumes/` folder.

## Usage (Commands)

All commands are run from the terminal in the project's root directory.

### 1\. Process Resumes (`process`)

This is the first and most important command. It reads all PDFs from the `resumes/` folder, sends them to the Gemini API for analysis, and saves the results in `resume_data.csv`.

```bash
python main.py process resumes/
```

*You only need to run this once for a new batch of resumes.*

### 2\. View All Candidates (`view`)

Displays a clean, formatted table of all the candidates that have been processed.

```bash
python main.py view
```

### 3\. Search for Candidates (`search`)

Filter candidates based on their tech stack and years of experience.

**Arguments:**

  - `--tech <technology>`: Filter by a specific technology (e.g., "Python", "React").
  - `--exp <years>`: Filter by a minimum number of years of experience.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Find candidates who know "Java"
python main.py search --tech "Java"

# Find candidates with at least 5 years of experience
python main.py search --exp 5

# Find candidates who know "Python" AND have at least 2 years of experience
python main.py search --tech "Python" --exp 2
```

### 4\. Sort Candidates (`sort`)

Sort the list of candidates by a specific column.

**Arguments:**

  - `--by <column_name>`: The column to sort by (e.g., `experience_in_years`, `name`).
  - `--order <asc|desc>`: The sort order. `asc` for ascending, `desc` for descending (default).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Sort by experience (most experienced first)
python main.py sort --by experience_in_years --order desc

# Sort by name in alphabetical order
python main.py sort --by name --order asc
```

```
```
